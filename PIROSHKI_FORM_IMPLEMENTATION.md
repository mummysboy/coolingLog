# Piroshki, Calzone, Empanada Heat Treating & Cooling CCP 2 Form Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a new form type for the FoodChillingLog application based on the "Piroshki, Calzone, Empanada Heat Treating & Cooling CCP 2" form specification.

## Form Structure

### Main Data Entry Table (Rows 1-4)
The form includes a main table with the following columns:
- **Date**: Date input for each entry
- **Heat Treating Step**: Temperature must reach 165°F or greater
  - Type (Piroshki, Calzone, Empanada)
  - Temperature (°F)
  - Time
  - Initials
- **126°F or greater CCP 2**: Record temperature of 1st and LAST rack/batch of the day
  - Temperature (°F)
  - Time
  - Initials
- **80°F or below within 105 minutes CCP 2**: Record temperature of 1st rack/batch of the day
  - Temperature (°F)
  - Time
  - Initials
- **55°F or below within 4.75 hr**
  - Temperature (°F)
  - Time
  - Initials
- **Chill Continuously to 40°F or below**
  - Temperature (°F)
  - Time
  - Initials

### LAST RACK/BATCH of Production Day Section (Rows 5-9)
A separate section for the final production batch with the same CCP columns but without the Heat Treating Step.

### Bottom Section
- **Thermometer #**: Input field for thermometer identification
- **Quantity and Flavor Produced**: Table with 3 rows for quantity and flavor tracking
- **Ingredients and Lot Information**: Table for Beef and Chicken lot numbers
- **Pre Shipment Review**: Fields for date, initials, and results (Pass/Fail)
- **Corrective Actions & Comments**: Large text area for notes

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Type Definitions (`src/lib/paperFormTypes.ts`)
- Added new `FormType.PIROSHKI_CALZONE_EMPANADA` enum value
- Extended `PaperFormRow` interface with new fields:
  - `heatTreating`: Heat treating step data
  - `ccp2_126`: CCP 2 126°F data
  - `ccp2_80`: CCP 2 80°F data
  - `ccp2_55`: CCP 2 55°F data
- Extended `PaperFormEntry` interface with new fields:
  - `quantityAndFlavor`: Object for tracking quantity and flavor
  - `preShipmentReview`: Pre shipment review data

### 2. GraphQL Schema (`amplify/backend/api/foodchillinglog/schema.graphql`)
- Updated `FormType` enum to include `PIROSHKI_CALZONE_EMPANADA`
- Extended `PaperFormRow` type with new fields
- Extended `PaperFormEntry` type with new fields
- Added `PreShipmentReview` type
- Updated input types for mutations

### 3. Form Component (`src/components/PiroshkiForm.tsx`)
- New React component implementing the exact form layout
- Responsive design matching the original form structure
- Integration with existing form store and validation system
- Support for both regular and admin editing modes

### 4. Form Selection Page (`src/app/form/page.tsx`)
- Added new form type to the dropdown menu
- Conditional rendering to show appropriate form component
- Updated form creation logic

### 5. Admin Page (`src/app/admin/page.tsx`)
- Updated to support the new form type
- Conditional rendering for admin editing

## Database Schema Changes

### New Fields in PaperFormEntry
```graphql
quantityAndFlavor: AWSJSON
preShipmentReview: PreShipmentReview
```

### New Fields in PaperFormRow
```graphql
heatTreating: StageData
ccp2_126: StageData
ccp2_80: StageData
ccp2_55: StageData
```

### New Type
```graphql
type PreShipmentReview {
  date: String
  initials: String
  results: String
}
```

## Usage

### Creating a New Form
1. Navigate to the form page (`/form`)
2. Click "Add Form" button
3. Select "Piroshki, Calzone, Empanada Heat Treating & Cooling CCP 2" from the dropdown
4. Fill in the form data according to the structure above

### Form Validation
- Temperature fields accept numeric values with decimal precision
- Time fields use the existing TimePicker component
- Initials are automatically converted to uppercase
- All fields are required for form completion

### Data Storage
- Form data is stored in AWS DynamoDB via GraphQL API
- Local storage backup for offline functionality
- Real-time synchronization when online

## Deployment

The new form type has been deployed to AWS:
- GraphQL schema updated and deployed
- New types and fields available in the API
- Form component integrated into the application

## Testing

To test the new form:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/form`
3. Create a new Piroshki form
4. Verify all fields are functional
5. Test form completion and status updates

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the Piroshki form:
- Temperature validation rules (e.g., 165°F minimum for heat treating)
- Time sequence validation (e.g., cooling stages must follow heat treating)
- Automated compliance checking
- Integration with HACCP monitoring systems
- Export functionality for regulatory compliance

## Notes

- The form maintains the exact layout and structure of the original paper form
- All existing functionality (admin editing, validation, storage) is preserved
- The form integrates seamlessly with the existing application architecture
- No breaking changes to existing forms or functionality
