# Piroshki Form API Resolvers

This directory contains custom resolvers for the Piroshki Form API.

## Available Resolvers

- Custom resolvers can be added here for specific business logic
- Default resolvers are auto-generated by Amplify

## Usage

To add a custom resolver:

1. Create a new resolver file (e.g., `CustomResolver.js`)
2. Implement the resolver logic
3. Reference it in your schema.graphql file

## Example

```javascript
// CustomResolver.js
export const request = (ctx) => {
  // Custom request logic
  return ctx.args;
};

export const response = (ctx) => {
  // Custom response logic
  return ctx.result;
};
```
